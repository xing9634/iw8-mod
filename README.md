# iw8-mod

<p align="center">

</p>

NOTE: You must legally own [Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000950/) to run this mod. Cracked/Pirated versions of the game are **NOT** supported.

## Compile from source

- Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.
  > You can run
  > ```
  > git clone https://github.com/xifil/iw8-mod.git --recurse-submodules
  > ```
  > or
  > ```
  > git clone https://gitlab.com/xifil/iw8-mod.git --recurse-submodules
  > ```
  > depending on what Git you would like to use, however you always need the `--recurse-submodules` flag.
- Update the submodules and run `premake5 vs2019` or simply use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `iw8_vs2019.sln`.

> Currently `vs2022` isn't a valid configuration as any mutex will fail to lock and cause an access violation, if you think you can figure this out you are literally insane, I've tried and failed and nothing I do fixes this.

academic research. It is not intended to be used to attack

## Usage

<!--iw8-mod is currently unusable on the newest version (v1.67)
of Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare, you are required to have
the Season 2 version (v1.20) with the left-over debug
executable, `game_dx12_ship_replay.exe`. Once built, replace
`discord_game_sdk.dll` in your game directory and run
`game_dx12_ship_replay.exe`. Alternatively, you can build in
`ReleaseShip` and launch `ModernWarfare.exe`.-->

iw8-mod supports these versions of Modern Warfare:  
- 1.20.4.7623265 (ModernWarfare & game_dx12_ship_replay) <!-- They're the same exact thing -->
- 1.38.3.9489393
- 1.44.0.10435696

Support may be coming for:  
- 0.01.2.7089334
- 1.03.0.7209368

Keep in mind that only 1.20/replay fully works "online" right now, all other versions don't get past the main menu and crash after ~2 minutes due to anti-tampering mechanisms put in place by Infinity Ward.

The same `discord_game_sdk.dll` can be used for all the versions as it auto-detects the version based on the executable and calculates the signatures based on that.
